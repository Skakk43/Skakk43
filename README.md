## Hi there 👋

I'm Skakk! I'm a master's student in animal science learning bioinformatics 🌱.
🎯 The objective is applying to bioinformatics PhD at the end of the year.

My master's project is about exploratory data analysis of genomes and epigenomes of wildlife populations. Our lab has many cool samples like 🐈 bobcat, 🦊 red fox, 🐺 coyote, and 🦝 raccoon from North America. I'm really excited!

Aside from the main project, I'm looking to work on 2-3 personal projects and post it on GitHub to showcase my programming skills. Ideally these would be analyzing/presenting open access biological data and practice the programming skills necessary for my main project. I will also post any class assignments that can go public.

🤔 I’m looking for help with:
- Any suggestions on pop gen tools that analyze quantitative data input (methylation β-value) instead of categorical data (ACTGs)

💬 Ask me about:
- horses! cattle! and maybe wildlife
- Eastern asian culture
- Mandarin
